\section{Content in file Ray.lean}

In this file, we define the class of segments, rays and their coercions, as well as basic properties.  A more precise plan is the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
We define the corresponding classes: rays, segments, and nondegenerate segments. 
\item 
We define the coercions among these concepts as well as coercions to directions, or projective directions.
\item 
We give different ways to make a segment or a ray.
\item 
We discuss compatibility of the coercion functions.
\item 
We introduce the concept of reversing a segment, that is to switch the start and end point of a segment.
\item 
We define the length function of a segment.
\item 
We define the concept of extending a segment into a ray.
\item 
We define the function that gives the midpoint of a segment.
\item 
We discuss the Archimedean property of a segment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Class \verb|Ray|: A \emph{ray} consists of a pair of a point $P$ and a direction; it is the ray that starts at the point and extends in the given direction.

\item
Class \verb|Seg|: A \emph{Segment} consists of a pair of points: the source and the target; it is the segment from the source to the target. (We allow the source and the target to be the same.)

\item
Definition \verb|Seg.IsND|: Given a segment $AB$, this function returns whether the segment $AB$ is nondegenerate, i.e. whether $A \neq B$.

\item
Class \verb|SegND|: A \emph{nondegenerate segment} is a segment $AB$ that is nondegenerate, i.e. $A \neq B$.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coercion}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Definition \verb|Ray.toProj|: Given a ray, this function returns its projective direction; it is the projective direction of the direction of the ray.

\item 
Definition \verb|Ray.IsOn|: Given a point $A$ and a ray $ray$, this function returns whether $A$ lies on $ray$; here saying that $A$ lies on $ray$ means that the vector from the start point of the ray to $A$ is some nonnegative multiple of the direction vector of the ray.

\item
Definition \verb|Ray.IsInt|: Given a point $A$ and a ray, this function returns whether the point lies in the interior of the ray; here saying that a point lies in the interior of a ray means that it lies on the ray and is not equal to the source of the ray.

\item 
Definition \verb|Ray.carrier|: Given a ray, its carrier is the set of points that lie on the ray.

\item 
Definition \verb|Ray.interior|: Given a ray, its interior is the set of points that lie in the interior of the ray.

\item 
Definition \verb|Seg.IsOn|:  Given a point $A$ and a segment $seg$, this function returns whether $A$ lies on $seg$; here saying that $A$ lies on $seg$ means that the vector from the source of $seg$ to $A$ is a real multiple $t$ of the vector of $seg$ with $0 \leq t \leq 1$.

\item
Definition \verb|Seg.IsInt|: Given a point $A$ and a segment $seg$, this function returns whether $A$ lies in the interior of $seg$; here saying that $A$ lies in the interior of $seg$ means $A$ lies on $seg$ and is different from the source and the target of $seg$.

\item Definition \verb|Seg.carrier|: Given a segment, this function returns the set of points that lie on the segment.

\item Definition \verb|Seg.interior|: Given a segment, this function returns the set of points that lie in the interior of the segment.

\item
{\color{red} To change the definition}
Definition \verb|Ray.mk_pt_pt|: Given two distinct points $A$ and $B$, this function returns the ray starting from $A$ in the direction of $B$. By definition, it is to first construct the nondegenerate segment from $A$ to $B$, and then convert the nondegenerate segment $AB$ to the associated ray using \verb|toRay| function.

\item
Definition \verb|RAY| as \verb|Ray.mk_pt_pt|: This is to abbreviate \verb|Ray.mk_pt_pt| into \verb|RAY|.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coercion compatibility}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Theorem \verb|SegND.toDir_eq_toRay_toDir|: Given a nondegenerate segment, the direction associated to the nondegenerate segment is the same as the direction associated to the ray associated to the nondegenerate segment.

\item Theorem \verb|SegND.toProj_eq_toRay_toProj|: Given a nondegenerate segment,  the projective direction associated to the nondegenerate segment is the same as the projective direction associated to the ray associated to the nondegenerate segment.

Theorem \verb||
Given a line $l$ and two points $A$ and $B$ on $l$, if we choose a direction $dir$ that maps to the projective direction of $l$, then either $A$ lies on the ray starting $B$ in the direction $dir$, or $B$ lies on the ray starting at $A$ in the direction $dir$.

\section{Content in Parallel.lean}

In this file, we define the concept for two lines to be parallel. A more precise plan is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We define a class called linear objects, consisting of one of the five types: nondegenerate vector, direction, ray, nondegenerate segment, and line.

\item We define the meaning of any pair of linear objects to be parallel.

\item We prove that coercion among linear objects generates linear objects that are parallel to the original ones.

\item We prove theorems related to that non-parallel lines intersection, and define the intersections.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Linear Objects and its coercion}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Inductive \verb|LinearObj|: A linear object is one of the following five types: a nondegenerate vector, a direction, a ray, a nondegenerate segment, or a line.

\item
Coercion: In the following, we define natural ways to view a nondegenerate vector, a direction, a ray, a nondegenerate segment or a line, as a linear object.

\item
Definition \verb|toProj|: Given a linear object, we return its associated projective direction, which is the associated projective direction in each of the five instances of a linear object.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition of parallel}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Definition \verb|parallel|: Given two linear objects $l_1$ and $l_2$ (not necessarily of the same type), this function returns whether they are parallel, defined as having the same associated projective direction.

\item 
\verb|parallel| is an instance of \verb|Equiv|: Being parallel defines an equivalence relation among all linear objects, that is they satisfy the three conditions: (1) reflexive: every linear object $l$ is parallel to itself; (2) symmetric: if the linear object $l_1$ is parallel to the linear object $l_2$, then $l_2$ is $l_1$; (3) transitive: if the linear object $l_1$ is parallel to the linear object $l_2$, and if the linear object $l_2$ is parallel to the linear object $l_3$, then $l_1$ is parallel to $l_3$.

\item Definition \verb|ParallelTo| as \verb|parallel|: This is to rewrite \verb|parallel l l'| as \verb|l ParallelTo l'|.

\item Definition $\parallel$ as \verb|parallel|: This is to rewrite \verb|parallel l l'| as $l \parallel l'$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel Theorems}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Theorem \verb|ray_parallel_toLine|: Given a ray, the ray is parallel to the line associated to the ray.

\item 
Theorem
\verb|segnd_parallel_toRay|: Given a nondegenate segment, it is parallel to the ray associated to this nondegenerate segment.

\item \toadd Lots of such similar theorem regarding coercions among linear objects
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intersection Theorems}



\section{Content in Perpendicular.lean}

In this file, we define the concept for two linear objects to be perpendicular. A more precise plan is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We define the meaning for two linear objects to be perpendicular.
\item We briefly discuss the basic properties.
\item We discuss the relation between parallel linear objects and perpendicular linear objects.
\item We construct the line through a point perpendicular to a given line.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Definition \verb|perpendicular|: Given two linear objects, this function returns whether they are perpendicular, defined as whether their associated projective directions are perpendicular.
\item Define \verb|IsPerpendicularTo| as \verb|perpendicular|: This to rewrite \verb|perpendicular l l'| as \verb|l IsPerpendicularTo l'|.

\item Define $\perp$ as \verb|perpendicular|: This to rewrite \verb|perpendicular l l'| as $l \perp l'$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic properties}
\begin{itemize}
\item Theorem \verb|perpendicular.irrefl|: For a linear object $l$, it is not perpendicular to itself.

\item Theorem \verb|perpendicular.symm|: For two linear objects $l_1$ and $l_2$, $l_1 \perp l_2$ if and only if $l_2 \perp l_1$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perpendicular and parallel}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Theorem
\verb|parallel_of_perp_perp|: Given three linear objects $l_1$, $l_2$, $l_3$, if $l_1 \perp l_2$ and $l_2 \perp l_3$, then $l_1 \parallel l_3$.

\item
Theorem \verb|perp_of_parallel_perp|: Given three linear objects $l_1$, $l_2$, $l_3$, if $l_1 \parallel l_2$ and $l_2 \perp l_3$, then $l_1 \perp l_3$.
\item
Theorem \verb|perp_of_perp_parallel|: Given three linear objects $l_1$, $l_2$, $l_3$, if $l_1 \perp l_2$ and $l_2 \parallel l_3$, then $l_1 \perp l_3$.

\item Theorem \verb|toProj_ne_toProj_of_perp|: Given two linear objects $l_1$ and $l_2$, if $l_1 \perp l_2$, then the associated projected direction of $l_1$ is not equal to that of $l_2$.

\item Theorem \verb|not_parallel_of_perp|: Given two linear objects $l_1$ and $l_2$, if $l_1 \perp l_2$, then $l_1$ is not parallel to $l_2$.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perpendicular construction}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Definition \verb|perp_line|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$, this function returns the line through $A$ that is perpendicular to $l$; it is defined as the the line through $A$ with direction perpendicular to that of $l$.
\item 
Theorem \verb|toProj_of_perp_line_eq_toProj_perp|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$, the projective direction of the line through $A$ perpendicular to $l$ is the perpendicular projective direction of $l$.

\item 
Theorem \verb|perp_foot_preparation|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$, the projective direction of the line through $A$ perpendicular to $l$ is not the same as the projective direction of $l$.

\item 
Definition \verb|perp_foot|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$, the function returns the perpendicular foot of $A$ to $l$, i.e. the intersection of the perpendicular of $l$ through $A$ with $l$.

\item
Definition \verb|dist_pt_line|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$, this function returns the distance from $A$ to the line $l$, defined as the the length of the segment from $A$ to the perpendicular foot of $A$ to $l$.

\item 
Theorem \verb|perp_foot_eq_self_iff_lies_on|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$, the perpendicular foot of $A$ to $l$ is $A$ if and only if $A$ lies on $l$.

\item 
Theorem \verb|line_of_self_perp_foot_eq_perp_line_of_not_lies_on|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$ such that $A$ does not lie on $l$, the line through $A$ and the perpendicular foot of $A$ to $l$ is the line through $A$ that is perpendicular to $l$.

\item 
Theorem \verb|dist_eq_zero_iff_lies_on|: Given a point $A$ and a line $l$, the distance from $A$ to $l$ is zero if and only if $A$ lies on $l$.
