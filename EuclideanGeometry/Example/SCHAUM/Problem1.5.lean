In parallelogram $ABCD$, we have $AB, DC$ are of the same direction.
Since $P$ lies on $AB$, we have $AP, AB$ are of the same direction.
Since $R$ lies on $CD$, we have $RC, DC$ are of the same direction.
Therefore, $AP, RC$ are of the same direction.
With $AP = CR$, we know that $APCR$ is a parallelogram.

In parallelogram $ABCD$, we have $AD, BC$ are of the same direction.
Since $S$ lies on $AD$, we have $AS, AD$ are of the same direction.
Since $Q$ lies on $BC$, we have $QC, BC$ are of the same direction.
Therefore, $AS, QC$ are of the same direction.
With $AS = CQ$, we know that $ASCQ$ is a parallelogram.

Since $APCR$ is a parallelogram, we know that the midpoint of $PR$ is the same as the midpoint of $AC$.
Since $ASCQ$ is a parallelogram, we know that the midpoint of $QS$ is the same as the midpoint of $AC$.
Therefore, the midpoint of $PR$ is the same as the midpoint of $QS$.
As a consequence, we know that $PQRS$ is a parallelogram.
