/- Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the enclosed median in one triangle are respectively equal to two sides and the enclosed median of the other.

In other words, let $\triangle A_1B_1C_1$ and $\triangle A_2B_2C_2$ be two triangles and let $A_1M_1$ and $A_2M_2$ be the corresponding medians. Suppose that $A_1B_1 = A_2B_2$, $A_1C_1 = A_2C_2$, and $A_1M_1 = A_2M_2$.

Prove that $\triangle A_1B_1C_1$ is congruent to $\triangle A_2B_2C_2$. -/

-- Don't prove this yet, the way to prove this is to extend $A_1M_1$ to $D_1$ so that $A_1 B_1 D_1 C_1$ is a parallelogram... Parallelogram.lean is not ready yet.

/- Let $D$ and $E$ be points on two sides $AB$ and $AC$ of a triangle $ABC$, respectively, such that $BD = BC = CE$. The segments $BE$ and $CD$ intersect at $F$.

Prove that $\angle BFD = \pi / 2 - \angle CAB$. -/
